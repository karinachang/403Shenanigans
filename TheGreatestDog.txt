Mosey
Oh Mosey
You are the greatest dog
May you live forever

Your fur is brown
Your nose wet
And smile warm

Get off of my bed
Your paws are muddy

gross

Okay fine
Get back up here

Why do you breath so loudly
at 3am
also your breath is hot
What's up with that

Honey Butter is just as great
Her tail so posh
and coat so fair

I wish she didn't
sleep in her litter
because now I cant touch her
